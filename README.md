# Engineering for Reliability and Stability in the Azure Messaging Services

Anything that can go wrong will go wrong at some point, so it is best to come prepared. Whether you are in the cloud or running your own data center, there is always a risk of power outages, hardware failures, natural disasters, or other unexpected events. These can be especially impactful for critical components in your architecture, such as your message broker. In this session, we explore capabilities that enhance the reliability and stability of Azure Messaging services, specifically Service Bus and Event Hubs.

We first look at high-availability options provided by Azure, including transient error handling and Availability Zones, which offer a solid foundation for building reliable workloads. Furthermore, we also examine advanced features that provide additional resilience in unexpected situations, such as Geo-Replication.

Our recommendations are not limited to the platform itself. We also cover improvements you can implement when building and hosting applications, including retry and exception handling, and the various hosting models available for clients.

By attending this session, you will learn practical tips and guidelines directly from the Azure Messaging product group, helping you prepare for unplanned events and maintain confidence in the reliability of your systems.
